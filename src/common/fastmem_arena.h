/**
 * A contiguous 4 GiB virtual-address-space mirror of the emulated 32-bit guest address space,
 * used as a Dynarmic fastmem arena. Guest RAM backings are allocated from one shared-memory
 * file so mapped guest pages can be mirrored into the arena at their guest virtual address:
 * host_address = ArenaBase() + guest_vaddr. Unmapped (or rasterizer-cached) guest pages stay
 * PROT_NONE in the arena, so JIT accesses fault and Dynarmic falls back to the page table.
 *
 * Only implemented for 64-bit Linux/Android hosts; elsewhere IsValid() is always false and
 * callers must keep using the page-table path.
