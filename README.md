<b>AzaharTrigger</b> is a fork of the Azahar Plus 3DS emulator with extra features.

I added some extra features too (klark231)
Chat Overlay Support
Custom Layout Drag and Pinch Support

Each version is the same as the corresponding version of Azahar exept for this:
- Compatibility with all game files. If a file works with any Citra fork, it works with AzaharPlus.
- Ability to download system files from official servers. No need for an actual 3DS.
- Compatibility with older CPUs (no SSE4.2 required)
- Compatibility with Android 9
- ZipPass: A new way to exchange StreetPass data through zip files

- Added back local multiplayer, from Kleidis and rebased by diegolix29

# ZipPass

ZipPass allows you to share StreetPass data in the form of zip files.<br>
On desktop it is in File > ZipPass. On android it is in the main menu.

- It can only be used when no game is running.
- It requires system files and LLE modules enabled.
- You need to enable StreetPass in your games.
- The export feature will save the StreetPass data of all your games in a xxx.pass.zip file.
- The import feature lets you pick one or several xxx.pass.zip files and will simulate StreetPass tags.
- You can pick as many files as you want for the import but every game has a limit for its queue and anything - beyond that will be ignored.
- This is all pretty experimental so in case of issues, I added a menu to disable StreetPass on every game. You won't lose anything, you will simply need to enable StreetPass again.
- I opened a topic on the github for people to share their data: [ZipPass Exchange](https://github.com/AzaharPlus/AzaharPlus/discussions/117)
